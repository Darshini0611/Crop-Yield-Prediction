            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to our Crop Yield Prediction platform! Our mission is to leverage the power of machine learning and advanced data analytics to help farmers, agronomists, and researchers make informed decisions to optimize crop yields.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to provide a reliable and accurate crop yield prediction system that can assist in agricultural planning and decision-making processes. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we analyze various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and historical crop data to predict future yields.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
                Our team is comprised of experts in the fields of agriculture, data science, and machine learning. We are passionate about innovation in agriculture and dedicated to helping the farming community achieve better results through technology.
            </p>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Our system collects and processes data from multiple sources including satellite imagery, weather forecasts, and soil sensors. The machine learning models are trained on this data to recognize patterns and predict crop yields with high accuracy. Our platform provides users with easy-to-understand visualizations and insights to support their agricultural practices.
